This code snippet is using the Rust programming language and it is creating a mutable variable named "counter" and setting its initial value to 0. The "mut" keyword before the variable name indicates that the variable can be changed or mutated. 

The next line defines a function named "inc" which does not take any parameters. Inside the function, the value of the "counter" variable is incremented by 1 using the "+=" operator. 

The Rust equivalent code to the given snippet is creating a mutable variable and a function to increment its value. This code can be executed multiple times to increment the value of the "counter" variable each time the "inc" function is called.
